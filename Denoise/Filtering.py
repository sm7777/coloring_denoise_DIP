        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Note: Here when we perform filtering we are not doing convolution.
        For every pixel in the image, we select a neighborhood of values defined by the kernal and apply a mathematical
        operation for all the elements with in the kernel. For example, mean, median and etc.

        Steps:
        1. add the necesssary zero padding to the noisy image, that way we have sufficient values to perform the operati
        ons on the pixels at the image corners. The number of rows and columns of zero padding is defined by the kernel size
        2. Iterate through the image and every pixel (i,j) gather the neighbors defined by the kernel into a list (or any data structure)
        3. Pass these values to one of the filters that will compute the necessary mathematical operations (mean, median, etc.)
        4. Save the results at (i,j) in the ouput image.
        5. return the output image

        Note: You can create extra functions as needed. For example if you feel that it is easier to create a new function for
        the adaptive median filter as it has two stages, you are welcome to do that.
        For the adaptive median filter assume that S_max (maximum allowed size of the window) is 15
